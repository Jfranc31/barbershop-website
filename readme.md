## Overview
This project is a responsive website for **923 Barber Shop**, designed to showcase the shopâ€™s services, barbers, and hairstyles while providing visitors with an easy way to inquire about appointments. The site uses **Bootstrap** for layout and styling alongside custom CSS for a modern, professional look.  

## Features
- **Home Page**: Hero section with hours and a call-to-action button.  
- **Barbers Page**: Profiles of barbers with names and images.  
- **Hairstyles Page**: Display of popular hairstyle options with descriptions.  
- **Contact Page**: Appointment inquiry form where users can select a barber, hairstyle, and leave their contact information and notes.  
- **Responsive Design**: Works across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.  
- **Navigation & Footer**: Clean navbar with offcanvas support and a structured footer with contact info.  

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3**  
- **Bootstrap 5**  

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the project files.  
1. Open `index.html` in your browser to explore the site.  
1. Navigate between the pages (Home, Barbers, Hairstyles, Contact) using the navbar.  
1. On the **Contact** page, you can fill out the appointment inquiry form.  
   - By default, the form submits to `http://localhost:3000/processform` (you can replace this with your own backend or form handler).  

## Ideas for Future Improvement
1. **Backend Integration**: Add a working backend to handle appointment requests and store them in a database.
1. **Online Booking Calendar**: Allow clients to pick available time slots when booking an appointment.
1. **Admin Dashboard**: Create a management panel where barbers or staff can view and confirm appointments.
